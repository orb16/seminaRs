# Implementing models in R
This seminar covers primarily implementing models in R, rather than the statistical assumptions and knowledge required to run them.  Implementation of the following models is covered: 
* Simple linear regression
* Multiple regression
* Model simplification
* Anova
* post-hoc (Tukey)
* GLMs

## Materials include: 
* Handout (pdf)
* R script
* Data to be saved in your working directory (distribution_trout.txt, ozone.data.txt and tannin.txt)
* Supplementary worked example on predicting from your models (not covered in this seminar originally, but in a separate session.) This has both an .Rmd, or if you are not used to using .Rmds, just use the pdf - both called "model_preddiction".

__Seminar presented originally__ by Hannah Franklin and Ursula Torres at both universities:

__Hannah Franklin__ is a PhD candidate at Lincoln University (NZ). She has recently submitted her thesis which investigated the potential of New Zealand native plants to mitigate nitrogen fluxes from agricultural land. Her research interests include many areas within the environmental sciences, in particular biogeochemistry, landscape and freshwater ecology. During her Masters research Hannah developed skills in spatial analysis using R. Nowadays she mostly uses R to efficiently analyse experimental and field survey data (using a variety of models) and to produce high quality graphics. â€‹
