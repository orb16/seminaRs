## ggplot seminars: guide to files 

Welcome to the ggplot2 tutorial files! We suggest if you have not encountered ggplot before, you start with the r script "seminar_6_ggplot_beginner.R" (and its accompanying answers file). Then move on as below.

If you've done a bit of plotting in ggplot you may wish to follow the "seminar_6_ggplot_intermediate" - either the .Rmd, or if you prefer, just follow using the pdf version.  

And if you really just want to customise the colours of ggpairs, make a map with your study locations or a graph with your study species, check out the "ggplot_extended_A" and "ggplot_extended_B" files - either as the .Rmd or in the .html/pdf forms.
