## ggplot seminars: guide to files 

Welcome to the ggplot2 tutorial files! We suggest if you have not encountered ggplot before, you start with the r script "seminar_6_ggplot_beginner.R" (and its accompanying answers file). Then move on as below.

If you've done a bit of plotting in ggplot you may wish to follow the "seminar_6_ggplot_intermediate" - either the .Rmd, or if you prefer, just follow using the pdf version.  

And if you really just want to customise the colours of ggpairs, make a map with your study locations or a graph with your study species, check out the "ggplot_extended_A" and "ggplot_extended_B" files - either as the .Rmd or in the .html/pdf forms.

Materials presented by Jennifer Bufford and Olivia Burge at the Lincoln and Canterbury ggplot seminars respectively.  

Jennifer Bufford is a postdoctoral fellow at the Bio-Protection Research Centre at Lincoln University (NZ).  She is working with Phil Hulme to examine fungal pathogen accumulation on introduced plants in New Zealand.  Invasion biology, plant ecology and seed and seedling biology are Jennifer’s key research interests and she uses R extensively for data processing and database management, creating figures for publication, and various statistical analyses, particularly generalized linear mixed effects modelling.

Olivia Burge is a PhD candidate at the University of Canterbury (NZ). Her research attacks (enthusiastically) the question of forest regeneration in NZ’s largest Ramsar wetland using a range of field experiments and models.  She uses R for big data adventures, data manipulation, spatial analysis (in combination with Netlogo), experimental analysis (primarily mixed models, boosted regression trees and associated) and multivariate analyses.
