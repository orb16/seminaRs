These files are from the Universities of Lincoln and Canterbury collaborative seminar series run in 2014.  The seminars were aimed at biologists at the universities (undergraduate up to faculty) who were interested in becoming more familiar with R.  Seminar presenters from both universities were teaching the lessons, tips and tricks they wished they knew when they were beginning their projects.
