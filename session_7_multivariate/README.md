# Multivariate data analysis

The powerpoint contains _a very basic_ overview of different kinds of constrained and unconstrained ordinations, and when you might use them.

The R script covers implementation of the following in R:

* PCA
* NMDS
* anosim
* adonis
* betadisper
* RDA
* dbRDA

__Jon Bray__ recently graduated with a PhD from the University of Canterbury. See: http://www.biol.canterbury.ac.nz/ferg/people.shtml for a brief profile.

__Olivia Burge__ is a PhD candidate at the University of Canterbury. Her research attacks (enthusiastically) the question of forest regeneration in NZâ€™s largest Ramsar wetland using a range of field experiments and models.  She uses R for big data adventures, data manipulation, spatial analysis (in combination with Netlogo), experimental analysis (primarily mixed models, boosted regression trees and associated) and multivariate analyses.
