# Session 3: Basic programming

## This session aims for you to:

* Get to know the basic syntax for programming in R
* Be able to create different loops (for loops, single or nested)
* Be able to use control flow statements (if... else)
* Explore different ways of applying functions to the data
* Create basic functions

## Materials include

* Presentation (pdf)
* Seminar outline (.doc)
* Script, and script with answers
* Traces, a file (with no extension) of data you will read in - covered in the script.

__Seminar originally presented__ by Laura Azzani and Camille Coux at the Canterbury version of this session. 

__Laura Azzani__: is a Phd student at the University of Canterbury (NZ) in chemical ecology/evolutionary biology.  She is researching the evolution of chemical profiles in birds species of the South Pacific, trying to unravel the evolutionary pressures that might have driven divergence in the profiles of closely related species.
She divides her time between the field, the chemistry lab and the office, and is a big fan of all things open source. She initally used R while working on her Master's thesis to fit GLMMs for which no proprietary statistical software was available. Nowadays, she uses R mostly for chemometrics. This covers anything from community ecology, multivariate analyses, post-processing of chemical traces and plotting with base and ggplot. She has also started using R to process microsatellite data, and is currently working on writing ever better functions, clearer scripts and learning how to efficiently parallelize her code.

__Camille Coux__ is a PhD student at the University of Canterbury (NZ) working on plant-insect interaction network structure and functional traits. She started programming R since the beginning of her masters to generate simulated data, and has never stopped using it since. She now uses R for modelling, statistics, and data management/manipulation. She strongly believes in the benefit of sharing data, code, tips and advice.
