# Session 3: Basic programming

## This session aims for you to:

* Get to know the basic syntax for programming in R
* Be able to create different loops (for loops, single or nested)
* Be able to use control flow statements (if... else)
* Explore different ways of applying functions to the data
* Create basic functions

## Materials include

* Presentation (pdf)
* Seminar outline (.doc)
* Script, and script with answers
* Traces, a file (with no extension) of data you will read in - covered in the script.

__Seminar originally presented__ by Laura Azzani and Camille Coux at the Canterbury version of this session. 

__Laura Azzani__: 
I am a Chemical Ecology/ Evolutionary Biology PhD student at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, NZ. I am currently researching the evolution of chemical profiles in birds species of the South Pacific, trying to unravel the evolutionary pressures that might have driven divergence in the profiles of closely related species.
I divide my time between the field, the chemistry lab and the office, and am a big fan of all things open source. I started getting seriously into R while working on my Master's thesis, when I needed to fit GLMM and none of the proprietary statistical softwares available at my previous University would let me. Nowadays, I use R mostly for chemometrics. This covers anything from community ecology, multivariate analyses, post-processing of chemical traces and plotting with base and ggplot. I have also started using R to process microsatellite data, and am currently working on writing ever better functions, clearer scripts and learning how to efficiently parallelize my code.

__Camille Coux__ is a PhD student at the University of Canterbury (NZ) working on plant-insect interaction network structure and functional traits. She started programming R since the beginning of her masters to generate simulated data, and has never stopped using it since. She now uses R for modelling, statistics, and data management/manipulation. She strongly believes in the benefit of sharing data, code, tips and advice.
